# Healthy Lifestyle Tracker
The Healthy Lifestyle Tracker is an application aimed to help users improve their daily lifestyle and be able to track key details to maintain a healthy life.

# Purpose
The main focuses of this tracker are workouts, nutrition, and
sleep. This application motivates users to log their daily activity and make a
difference in their routine. Users can either have a detailed log, choosing the
specifics of their workout or meals they’ve had during that day, or have a
simple log that doesn’t require much information if they are busy. Users can
view progress over time, such as workout frequency, calories burned, or
personal records. For nutrition, users can log meals and snacks, tracking
nutritional data such as calories, macronutrients (protein, carbs, fats), and
vitamins. In terms of tracking sleep, users can log their sleep duration and
quality each night. The focus will be to have users set specific goals related
to workouts, nutrition, and sleep (e.g., sleep 8 hours a night). There will be
some form of reward such as a streak for users continuing their habits. The
scope of the project will be on basic logging of workouts, meals, and sleep,
with progress tracking and goal-setting features.
